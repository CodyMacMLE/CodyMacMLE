# 💫 About Me:
I'm a 3rd-year Software Development student at Seneca Polytechnic with a passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI Engineering. With strong foundations in C, C++, Python, and full-stack development, I'm now expanding into AI and preparing to pursue an MSc of Research (MScR) in Deep Learning in 2027-2028.<br><br>My long-term goal is to become a Machine Learning Scientist working on high-impact problems in genomics, quantum computing, or AI. I'm particularly interested in future projects that intersect deep learning with DNA/RNA sequence analysis, and quantum machine learning<br>

As a dual Canadian–U.S. citizen, I’m open to internship and co-op opportunities in both countries. I'm available for Summer 2026 and Winter 2027 co-ops.

📈 **Project Roadmap (2025–2026)**<br>

1) Shenderey Web App (Summer 2025 - Winter 2026)
- Location: [https://www.astraltechbeta.dev]
- Github: [https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/ShendereyWebApp]
- Tech:
  - Next.js, SQL, Drizzle, REST API, TailwindCSS, Typscript, KindeAuth, AWS, CI/CD, Testing
- Description:
  - A basic CRUD webpage working with the client to build a modern web application for their business. Focused on a modern design while minimizing monthly costs when in production. The project includes a front facing webpage that consumers will view along with a admin dashboard with authentication. The dashboard displays estimated montly costs, allows the client to update key areas on the webpage like: class schedules, athlete profiles, and manage tryouts (tryouts are also sent via email to the client).
<br>

2) Project B (Winter 2026)
- Location: TBA
- Github: TBA
- Tech:
  - React Native, SQL, PyTorch, Python, TBA
- Description:
  - A pratical ML system that tracks attendance of athletes and predicts the churn rate, injury-risk, and attendance no-show predictions.
<br>

3) Project C (Winter 2026)
- Location: TBA
- Github: TBA
- Tech: TBA
- Description: A Computer Vision Application TBD after Project B
<br><br>

💻 **Projects**<br>

1) Fragments
- Location: None
- Github: [https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/fragments] && [https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/fragments-ui]
- Tech:
  - Next.js, AWS, REST API, TailwindCSS, Congnito, AWS, CI/CD, Testing, Docker
- Description:
  - A basic CRUD webpage built as a school project. The webpage implements a basic crud application seperating two repos, one as the front-end, the other as a backend API. The API focuses on less the functionality, but testing, CI/CD, containerization, github actions, and AWS cloud computing.
<br>

2) Mykit-learn
- Location: Github
- Github: [https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/mykit-learn]
- Description: My own implementation of scikit learns linear regression using gradient descent
<br>

3) Classical DSA
- Location: Github
- Github: [https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/mykit-learn](https://github.com/CodyMacMLE/classical-dsa)]
- Description: My own implementation of common data stuctures in python


🚀 Always open to connecting with engineers, researchers, and biotech professionals in AI/ML, genomics, and computational biology. Let’s build something impactful.
